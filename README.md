# Y2-Neural-Network
Module for learning and implementing a multi-layer perceptron (NN) and to improve its performance on a given set of data

This module was entirely just to learn about neurla networks and how they work, and how different changes to structure and hyperparameters can affect the performance.
The neural network used multiple data points from each day over a large period (wind, temperature, rain etc) and predict what the weather will be over the next time period.

The code was done in python and i recieved a 1st for it.
